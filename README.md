The Iris Flower Classification Machine Learning Project is designed to classify iris flowers into species (setosa, versicolor, or virginica) based on features like petal length, petal width, and sepal length. Through data exploration, model training, and evaluation, this project demonstrates the application of KNN classifier in real-world classification tasks.
